So below, that is an embedded flash card thing.

@g Numerical Analysis
@f Preconditioning
@b Basically wants to multiply an equation to make the matrices look more like
   the Identity matrix. This tries to save future computation.

   Preconditioning is for GMres.

@r hello,
@m dai: { 2.70, 3, 2018-10-10@14:31 }

@r you need
@m dai: { 2.70, 3, 2018-10-10@14:31 }

@r to go
@m dai: { 2.70, 3, 2018-10-10@14:31 }

@r away

@fro hello @bac bye

@f Jacobi Preconditioning
@b who doesn't do something like this.
   Does [Preconditioning] by using the diagonal matrix.

lua scripting for algorithms? That would be really cool actually. Or JS for
algorithms. (if it is in the browser).

Yeah, Lua scripting, but I'm not assuming the website. Maybe if a browser just
starts up, then that is good enough. Then that can be built off of in the
future. Even the things .... ?

So how will it look like in LUA for the creation of new algorithms? Either just
have global functions, or add the function to an array. Yeah... just global
functions is fine.

Are the default algorithms built into Go? That is another good question.

Pros: If the file is deleted, the program still works, Makes it easier for
people to use the program.

Cons: Kind of enforces a limitation

Or what if we just copy a Lua file to the correct location. No, there should be
a default location. There should be a default algorithm. I can copy the anki
algorithm.

Also, should there be a way to say, "I know this card".
Well, that could be just a "I know this" algorithm. Or just change the date to
some arbitrary time in the future. Actually, you never "know" something. You
should just move the date to 10 years from then. Nevermind, there could just be
a "known" algorithm.

I just have to assume that the "streak" and "next day to review" are not global
to every algorithm.

I will have to provide some API things for lua. Including date manipulation.
That will be important. Yeah, the Lua needs to have the current date. Dates are
just strings.

So the lua API includes string and math modules plus this date one:
```lua
-- if any of these have an error, then null is returned.
-- a "date" is just a string with a date and a time.
-- Returns the current date.
function date.today() end

-- if anything is larger than what it should be, then that adds to the date.
function date.create(year, month, day, hour, min) end

-- this returns all values as a table
-- { year=2018, month=6, day=16, hour=6, min=41 }
function date.parse() end

```

And a function would look like this:

function sm2(params, card)

end

There should
