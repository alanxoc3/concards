# Concards transition from v0.7.0 to v0.8.0 script.
# By Alan Morgan
#
# In this release, the curly braces were added as symbols "{}". The colon ":"
# was changed to a double colon "::". The "<@" and "@>" were both changed to
# "<:" and ":>". Special symbols contained in a card now have have hashes with
# backslashes. And finally, whitespace is not needed to be before and after
# symbols anymore when parsing through files.
#
# This isn't really a full fledged script, instead there are just a few ideas
# for how you can make the transition.

exit

# Convert "@>" and "<@"
find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/@>/:>/g" {} \;
find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/<@/<:/g" {} \;

# An idea to convert the single colon. This isn't guaranteed to work for
# everything.
find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/ : /:: /g" {} \;

# You might need/want to make changes if you have a card that has both a ":"
# and a "|", since the way those two play together were changed a bit in this
# release.

# And it's not worth it to change the metadata file for any cards that are
# affected by the escaping symbol change.
