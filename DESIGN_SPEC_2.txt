- @a, @n, @q all have a max character size of 2048.
- groups, alg names, and alg parameters all have a max character size of 64
- TH15154CH3CKSUM is a checksum of the question.
   - Whitespace is Whitespace is changed to a single space for the hash. But the whitespace is preserved for actually storing the card.

How should the time work?
   Time is always in the Greenwich timezone, RFC-3339, or it can be part of it.
   The reasoning to this is that people will rarely look at that. If they want
   control over it, then they need to understand it.

# File format:
All possible meta data things for 1.0:
```
   @> @! @q @a @n @m @t <@
```

## "@>"
Used to start the concards section. You MUST specify the group afterwards.

## "<@"
Ends the concards section. Concards will not interpret anything after this
until it encounters another section "@>".

## "@!"
Pass it a list of space separated strings, and those strings will be ignored
for the remainder of the concards section.

## "@q"
The question for a card. It uses the groups specified from "@>".

## "@a"
An answer for a card. It uses the groups specified from "@a". Multiple per
question.

## "@t"
The timestamp for a card. Only one per question.

## "@m"
One meta data per question.

## "@n"
Multiple notes per question.

@m, and @t on @>?
   They will give defaults to everything.

@a, and @n on @>?
   These give a default list of answers and notes to the next cards. If the
   card has any notes or answers, then these will be overridden.

Example with only one card:
```
@> group1 group2 @!
   @q Who was the first man to walk on the moon?
   @a Neil Armstrong
   @n Also, that was in the year 1969
   @t 2019-09-09 10:00:01Z
   @m sm2 2.70 3
@<
```

Options for duplicates:
- Ignore the duplicate. (Default)
- Overwrite your memory.
- Merge notes.

## File format verbose.
