Turning notes into flashcards.

## About
Concards is my ongoing attempt to make flashcards simple and quick to record or embed into a text document. Unlike the overhead of other flashcard applications, Concards accepts a minimal amount of rules. This allows tons of freedom in the way you want to create your own flashcards!

## Install
Install like any other go application.
``` bash
go get github.com/alanxoc3/concards-go;
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/alanxoc3/concards-go;
go build; # Or `./install.sh`
```

## Features
* Implements the [SM2](https://www.supermemo.com/english/ol/sm2.htm) Repetition Algorithm.
* Beautiful terminal gui.
* Supports UTF-8!
* Reading in from multiple files.
* Undoing/Redoing
* Easily editing a card while reviewing your cards.
* And More!!! (I think :)

## Usage
The file syntax was designed to be very simple and flexible, allowing anyone to quickly embed flashcards into their text document without extra hassle of other flashcard apps (like [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) or [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/)).
